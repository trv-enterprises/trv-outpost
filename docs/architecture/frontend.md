# Frontend architecture

The frontend is a single-page React application built with Vite. It
uses Carbon Design System (g100 dark theme), ECharts for data
visualization, and React Router for client-side navigation. Data
comes from the Go backend via REST, SSE, and a few WebSocket
endpoints.

## apiClient

`client/src/api/client.js` is a singleton. Every API call on the
frontend goes through it. The singleton holds the current user's
GUID (the value sent in the `X-User-ID` header), normalizes query
parameters (array-aware so tag filters send repeated params
correctly), and exposes typed methods per domain:
`getConnections`, `testConnection`, `getComponents`, `updateComponent`,
`getDashboard`, `getFrigateReviews`, `markFrigateReviewsViewed`,
`getAllTags`, etc.

Hooks and page components **should not** instantiate `fetch` or a
second client. If an endpoint isn't covered by the client, add a
method there.

## StreamConnectionManager

Real-time data uses a singleton `StreamConnectionManager` in
`client/src/utils/streamConnectionManager.js`. Multiple components
subscribing to the same datasource share one SSE connection — their
topic filters are combined into one subscription, and records are
dispatched to callbacks by client-side topic matching. See
[streaming.md](streaming.md) for the full protocol including the
30-second grace period on reconnects and the retained-state cache
that repopulates late subscribers.

## Pages

├── App-level routing lives in App.jsx
├── ConnectionsPage / ConnectionDetailPage
├── ChartsListPage / ChartDetailPage  (components list and editor)
├── DashboardsListPage / DashboardDetailPage
├── DashboardViewerPage          Main view-mode dashboard runner,
│                                 also hosts the edit-mode layout
│                                 editor now that DashboardDetailPage
│                                 has been folded in
├── DashboardTileViewPage        Tile-layout variant

├── Users / Settings / Devices / DeviceTypes   Manage mode
├── AIBuilderPage                 Standalone AI session page
└── LoginPage
```

Most pages call `apiClient` directly for their data, but a few
(dashboards, components) use shared hooks (`useData`, `useComponents`,
`useDatasources`) so list data can be shared across multiple
components on the same page.

## DynamicComponentLoader

Components (the chart sub-type, primarily) are stored in MongoDB as
strings of JavaScript source code. At render time,
`DynamicComponentLoader.jsx` evaluates that source inside a controlled
scope and returns the resulting React component. The scope contains:

- React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`,
  `useRef`, `useContext`
- ECharts: `echarts`, `ReactECharts`
- Carbon themes: `carbonTheme`, `carbonDarkTheme`
- Data utilities: `toObjects`, `getValue`, `formatTimestamp`
- Data props: the component's query result as `{ columns, rows }`

This is how AI-generated component code makes it from the AI Builder
session into a live dashboard panel without a build/deploy cycle.

## Control renderer and registry

All controls — buttons, toggles, sliders, switches, dimmers, tiles,
garage door, text labels — are rendered by `ControlRenderer.jsx`.
The renderer consults a global registry (`controlRegistry.js`) to
resolve `control.control_config.control_type` to a concrete React
component. Each concrete control module self-registers at import
time via `registerControl(type, Component)` so adding a new control
requires no manual wiring in the renderer.

Key rules:

- Controls that can't write (`canWrite: false`) are automatically
  passed `readOnly={true}` and don't need a command hook.
- `ControlRenderer` renders a `.control-title` panel header above the
  body for non-tile, non-text-label controls, using
  `control.title || control.name`. **Custom controls must not
  render their own title inside the body** — it creates a visible
  duplicate. The canonical layout is: panel title (from
  `ControlRenderer`) → icon/visual → state readout. See the "Custom
  Control Layout" section in the project `CLAUDE.md`.
- Tile controls (`tile_*`) skip the top title and manage their own
  inline label.

Metadata for each control type lives in `controlTypes.js`:
`CONTROL_TYPE_INFO[type] = { label, description, icon, category,
canWrite, canRead, defaultUIConfig, hidden? }`. The editor UI reads
from this map to populate its type picker and default config.

### State and commands

Controls talk to MQTT via two shared hooks:

- **`useControlState`** — subscribes to the control's state topic
  (derived from `target` by convention) and exposes the current
  value. Used by read-only status controls (garage door, sensors)
  and bidirectional controls (toggle, dimmer, switch) to keep the
  UI in sync with broker state.
- **`useControlCommand`** — sends commands through
  `POST /api/controls/:id/execute` with notification handling
  (success/error toasts). Write-capable controls use this.

## Shared tag components

`components/shared/`:

- **`TagInput.jsx`** — creatable input with autocomplete against a
  shared tag pool. Used in every edit form (connection, component,
  dashboard).
- **`TagFilter.jsx`** — multi-select dropdown scoped to a specific
  entity type, shows usage counts. Used in every list page and the
  component picker modal.
- **`tagsApi.js`** — session-level cache of the merged tag pool plus
  an `invalidateTagsCache()` function called after saves to force a
  re-fetch.

The shared pool is backed by `GET /api/tags`, which aggregates
`tags` arrays across connections, components, and dashboards. Tag
normalization (lowercase + kebab + dedupe) happens on the backend
during save, and the frontend mirrors the same normalization in
`TagInput` so the chip preview matches what will actually be
stored.

## Dashboard viewer and fit modes

`DashboardViewerPage.jsx` is the central runner for view mode. It
handles:

- Fetching the dashboard and its referenced charts/controls/displays
- Rendering the grid
- Applying the user's fit mode (Actual / Fit to window / Fit to
  width / Stretch to fill) — see [grid-system.md](grid-system.md)
- Running the auto-refresh loop
- Entering and exiting edit mode (which overlays a drag/resize
  editor on the same grid)
- Saving layout changes, dashboard settings, and tags

Because dashboards can contain a mix of charts (ECharts), controls
(device-facing), displays (Frigate camera, weather, alerts grid),
and native text panels, the viewer has a small dispatcher that
renders each panel's content type accordingly:

```jsx
chart.component_type === 'control'   → <ControlRenderer control={chart} />
chart.component_type === 'display'   → one of:
  display_type === 'weather'         → <WeatherDisplay />
  display_type === 'frigate_camera'  → <FrigateCameraViewer />
  display_type === 'frigate_alerts'  → <FrigateAlertsGrid />
chart                                 → <DynamicComponentLoader />
panel.text_config                    → <PanelText />
```

## Dashboard commands (MQTT)

The viewer subscribes to a single MQTT topic for "dashboard
commands" — JSON messages that drive UI actions (advance an alert,
dismiss a modal, etc.) from a voice assistant or kiosk controller.
The connection and topic are admin settings
(`dashboard_command_connection`, `dashboard_command_topic`); when
either is unset the subscription is skipped.

Message shape:

```json
{ "target": "frigate-alert", "action": "next" }
```

The viewer stores the latest command in state and passes it as a
prop to panel components. Each component compares
`dashboardCommand.target` to its own target string and switches on
`action`. Unknown targets and actions are ignored.

**Current scope — frigate-alert only.** As of v0.18.2 the only
component that consumes dashboard commands is `FrigateAlertsGrid`
(`target: "frigate-alert"`). Supported actions: `show` /
`show_alert`, `reviewed` / `dismiss`, `next`, `previous`, `close`.
No other component (charts, weather, controls, other displays) acts
on these messages today.

**No per-instance routing.** The topic is a single global setting,
so every connected viewer subscribes to the same topic and acts on
every command whose `target` matches a component it happens to be
rendering. In practice this is fine because the feature is only
used on the home kiosk, but if multiple viewer sessions are open
with a Frigate alerts panel loaded, a single command will fire on
all of them. A future per-instance scheme (treating the configured
topic as a prefix and appending a client id, e.g.
`dashboard/cmd/<client_id>`, so each viewer subscribes only to its
own subtopic) is possible but unimplemented.

## Styling

SCSS co-located with components (`Foo.jsx` + `Foo.scss`). The g100
dark Carbon theme is enforced globally in `App.scss`. Components
should use Carbon CSS custom properties (`var(--cds-text-primary)`,
`var(--cds-background)`) and Carbon spacing tokens rather than
hard-coded colors or pixel values. Exceptions are unavoidable when
dealing with ECharts options, which take concrete colors.

## Build tracking

`client/build.json` holds an integer build number that's
incremented on every functional change. The value shows up in the
Manage-mode footer and in logs so kiosk displays can confirm which
build they're running.
